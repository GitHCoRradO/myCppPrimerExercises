A compound statement,usually referred to as a block,is a (possibly empty) sequence of statements and declarations surrounded by a pair of curly braces.
Compound statements are used when the language requires a single statement but the logic of our program needs more than one.
For instance,the body of a while or for loop must be a single statement,yet we often need to execute more than one statement in the body of a loop.We do so by 
enclosing the statements in curly braces,thus turning the sequence of statements into a block.
