Ordered v Unordered Associative Containers

Ordered Associative Container
        Standard Traversal encounters elements in sorted order
        Order predicate may be specified
        Default order predicate is "less than", defined using operator< for the element type
        Popular implementations: OrderedVector, BinarySearchTree
        Search operations required to have O(log n) runtime
        Insert, Remove operations should either be seldom used or have O(log n) runtime
Unordered Associative Container
        Standard Traversal encounters elements in unspecified order
        Search, Insert, Remove operations should have average-case constant runtime
        Popular implementations use hashing
