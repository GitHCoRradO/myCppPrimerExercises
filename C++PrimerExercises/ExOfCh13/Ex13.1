A constructor is the copy constructor if its fisrt parameter is a reference to the class type and any additional parameters have default values.
the copy constructor is used when copy initializaion happens.
When copy initialization happens and that copy initialization requires either the copy constructor or the move constructor.

    Define variables using an =
    Pass an object as an argument to a parameter of nonreference type
    Return an object from a function that has a nonreference return type
    Brace initialize the elements in an array or the members of an aggregate class
    Some class types also use copy initialization for the objects they allocate.
